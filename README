Network Security assignment 1
Roberto Amorim - rja2139

* The RSA keys were generated with OpenSSL:
openssl genrsa -out privkey1.pem 2048

*** ATTENTION ***
I have not programmed the server to be multithreaded. It runs on a sequential thread: first
it receives the file from client 1, closes that connection, then opens another connection to
send the file to client 2.
For that reason, even when running in untrusted mode the server NEEDS to receive some file from
client 1 before sending the serverdata file to client 2, otherwise it will not even start 
listening at client 2's port.
